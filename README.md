# Estimatig the causal impact of awareness days on Twitter Intercations of NPOs 

This project is designed to estimate the causal effect of awarness days on the interactions of Twitter Users with NPOs in the field affected by the awareness day. 

Here is what I will do:

1. Use Python to store all Tweets from 30 NPOs from 3 sectors (human rights, envrionment, AIDS/HIV prevention) in a database
2. Use Google's CausalImpact Package in R to implement a syntethic control approach
